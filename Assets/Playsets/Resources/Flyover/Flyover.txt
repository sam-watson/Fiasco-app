"summary" : "Flyover is all about Middle America - hard-working agribusiness pro­fessionals, construction contractors, Mexican drug mules and the peo­ple who love them. It’s the God-and-country heartland, where high school football is the best bet for a Friday night date and everybody knows everybody. \\n With corn and soybean fields stretching for miles in every direction, the endless sky punctuated only by enormous grain elevators, things can get a little squirrelly.",

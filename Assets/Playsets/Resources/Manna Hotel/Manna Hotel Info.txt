	"summary": "The Manna Hotel is three miles north of Manna, Kansas, population 1,200.

The Manna Hotel is a twenty-room motor lodge with its own in-ground swimming pool, now unused. The hotel burned down and was rebuilt in the fifties. Wood paneling and window-unit air conditioners were installed in the seventies, and it looks like that's the last maintenance anyone did to the place.

Business has been slow ever since they moved the Interstate, so ten of the rooms are closed all the time now. The other ten rooms are rented and cleaned by a manager who lives on the premises.",
